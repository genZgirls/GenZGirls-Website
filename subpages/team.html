Akhila Boda is an eighteen-year-old gender equality activist and STEAMnist. In 2016, she founded Metro Girl Up club, a UN Foundation campaign club that advocates for female empowerment and girls’ education in third-world countries. When Akhila was young, she noticed gender disparities in India, most notably, her grandmothers who were married at fourteen. This observation sparked her interest in global gender equality and STEM education. In the past four years, her club has raised $10,000, which has helped re-enroll 100 girls in Guatemala, India, and Liberia. Additionally, as an Ohio Student Ambassador of ThinkSTEAM, Akhila organizes STEAM workshops for K-12 girls. Akhila knows that with a platform like GenZ Girls, young girls have the opportunity to hear unique stories and dream beyond the boundaries they are confined to. In the Fall of 2020, Akhila will study Biomedical Science at The Ohio State University and knows that with the help of everyone, global gender equality is not a dream. It is a vision.

<br>
<br>

<b>Fun Fact:</b> Akhila has been to the country of Georgia as a 2018 WiSci participant!
